This repo demonstrates how to develop a SageMaker model from your local environment.

local_dev.ipynb notebook demonstrates how to develop and deploy a model from your local environment. Note that you need to input your own IAM role. The role cannot be automatically generated using:

from sagemaker import get_execution_role

role = get_execution_role()

The above function only works if you are developing the model using SageMaker Studio or a SageMaker Notebook instance.


train.py script contains the training logic used during model training..

setup_commands.txt lists the steps to follow for setting up your local environment for SageMaker development.

data data folder contains the Iris dataset used for model training and testing.

local_training notebook demonstrates how to train and deploy sagemaker model on your local machine.
